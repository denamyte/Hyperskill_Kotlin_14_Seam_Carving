<h2>Custom annotations</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You already know about annotations – a way of providing <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, metadata is information about data that adds meaning and context to it. | In the context of programming, metadata is often provided through annotations. Annotations are a way to provide instructions and metadata to the compiler, IDE, or framework to handle complex tasks and make the code more efficient. Annotations can be used to provide information about other annotations, these are called meta-annotations. Meta-annotations indicate which kind of element can be targeted by the annotation, for example, local variables, classes, functions, etc.">metadata</a> about our code – and how to apply them. Today, we will learn about <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a custom annotation is a way to provide metadata about your code, just like built-in annotations, but with the ability to create your own. | Custom annotations are useful for a deeper understanding of built-in annotations and for creating your own library or framework. Declaring a custom annotation is similar to declaring a class, and you can add parameters to the constructor. Custom annotations can be used to target different elements in your code, such as a statement, function, class, or file. Custom annotations provide a way of providing instructions and metadata to the compiler, IDE, or framework, making your life easier by handling complex tasks.">custom annotations</a>, which is useful for two reasons. First, we'll get a deeper understanding of built-in annotations and of how to use them properly. Second, we will learn to do the magic by ourselves and make our own custom annotations, which you can use, for example, when you create your own library or framework. Now let's get started!</p>
<h5 id="your-first-custom-annotation">Your first custom annotation</h5>
<p>Declaring an annotation is similar to declaring a class – just add the <code class="language-kotlin">annotation</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/31660" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a modifier is a keyword used to define the accessibility and mutability of variables or members of a class. | For instance, the `var` keyword is a modifier that indicates a variable can be changed, while `val` indicates a variable is immutable. Additionally, modifiers such as `private` and `public` determine the scope of variable or class visibility. For example, a property declared with the `private` modifier can only be accessed within the same file or class, while a `public` modifier allows it to be accessed from anywhere in the program where the object is available.">modifier</a> in front of it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">annotation class CustomSuppress</code></pre>
<p>Annotations can also have constructors that take <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a parameter is a named value that is passed to a function or a class. | It is defined in the function or class header, followed by its type and an optional default value. Parameters can be of any type, and you can specify several parameters of arbitrary types in a class. When invoking a function with parameters, you can pass arguments by the name of these parameters to improve code readability, especially if the function has many parameters. Additionally, named parameters allow you to change the order of arguments passed in a function call.">parameters</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">annotation class CustomSuppress(vararg val errorName: String)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code class="language-kotlin">vararg</code> means that we can pass zero or more arguments, which is ideal in this situation.</p>
<p>Now let's use our previous custom annotation. Consider the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    @CustomSuppress("UNUSED_VARIABLE")
    val userName = "Alex"

    // This is also correct 
    // because vararg means zero or more arguments
    @CustomSuppress
    val phone = 1234567
}</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it works and there are no errors! Now, if someone writes this code in the IDE, they may wonder why our <code class="language-kotlin">@CustomSuppress</code> didn't suppress anything. Where is the magic?! Actually, to understand how annotations do their magic, we need to talk about "Annotation processing", which is out of scope of this topic, so now we'll just focus on creating annotations and applying them.</p>
<h5 id="parameters">Parameters</h5>
<p>What types of parameters are allowed to be passed to an annotation's constructor?</p>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/annotations.html#constructors" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>, the allowed parameter types include: </p>
<ul><li><p>Types that correspond to Java primitive types (Int, Long, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Strings</p></li><li><p>Classes (<code class="language-kotlin">Foo::class</code>)</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6245" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, enums are a container for a collection of constants. | They are a convenient way to store a fixed set of values, such as the days of the week or the suits in a deck of cards. Enums in Kotlin come with embedded properties and methods that allow you to access the name and order of the constants. You can retrieve all instances of an enum or just one of them. Additionally, you can extend your enum with custom behavior. Enums are a useful tool for improving code organization and readability. For example, you might create an enum for the colors of the rainbow, or for the status of an order.">Enums</a></p></li><li><p>Other annotations</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an array is a collection of elements of the same type that can be accessed by index. | It is a single unit that can process multiple values together, and its size cannot be changed once it is created. However, you can modify an element of an array by its index. Kotlin can handle arrays of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Each element in an array has an integer index, starting from 0 for the first element, making it easy to access and process them.">Arrays</a> of the types listed above</p></li></ul>
<p> The question now is: what is not allowed? Again quoting the official <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/annotations.html#constructors" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>, "Annotation parameters cannot have <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7619" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a nullable type is a variable that can hold a null value, in contrast to a non-nullable type, which cannot. | This is a key feature of Kotlin's null safety, which aims to eliminate null reference errors. In Kotlin, types are non-nullable by default, and if you want to declare a variable that can hold a null value, you must append a question mark to the type. When working with nullable types, Kotlin requires you to handle the possibility of a null value explicitly, making your code safer and more predictable.">nullable types</a> because the JVM does not support storing <code class="language-kotlin">null</code> as a value of an annotation attribute". The code in the following example will give an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Compile time error
// nullable types are NOT allowed
annotation class CustomSuppress(vararg val errorName: String?)</code></pre>
<p>Last but not least, if you pass an annotation as a parameter of another annotation, don't prefix it with the @ character and do it like in the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// A new custom annotation
annotation class Special(val why: String)

// Passing Special annotation as parameter
annotation class CustomSuppress(val name: Special)</code></pre>
<p>We have created two custom annotations and passed the <code class="language-kotlin">Special</code> annotation as a parameter to the second one – <code class="language-kotlin">CustomSuppress</code>. Simply put, think about passing it as a parameter like in the case of normal <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class is a fundamental component in object-oriented programming that serves as a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors. | It is the most important and fundamental component in the logging package, and the standard practice is to create a logger instance for each class. A class can contain methods to perform specific tasks, and in the context of logging, it can introduce several methods to print log messages. For instance, the method is used to print log messages, taking a level object and a message as arguments. In addition to regular nested classes, Kotlin also has inner classes, which are a special case of nested classes. An inner class can access members of its outer class, making it useful in specific scenarios, such as creating a nested class for a cat's ribbon bow. Furthermore, Kotlin supports generic programming, which allows writing more abstract and reusable code.">class</a> instantiation.</p>
<p>Now, let's use <code class="language-kotlin">CustomSuppress</code> from the example above and apply it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    @CustomSuppress(name = Special("IDK"))
    val userName = "Alexandr"
}</code></pre>
<p>To avoid confusion, applying an annotation is completely different from passing it as a parameter: to apply an annotation, you need to use the @ symbol. So let's edit the previous example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// A new Custom annotation
annotation class Special(val why: String)

// Passing Special annotation as parameter
// Applying @Special to this parameter
annotation class CustomSuppress(@Special("IDK") val name: Special)</code></pre>
<p> The last thing to be mentioned in this section is that an annotation parameter <strong>cannot</strong> be 'var':</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">//Compile time error
annotation class CustomSuppress(var name: String)</code></pre>
<h5 id="meta-annotations"> Meta-annotations</h5>
<p>Annotations provide metadata about our code, right? However, we can also use annotations to provide metadata about other annotations. The annotations that annotate other annotations are called "Meta-annotations".</p>
<p>Meta-annotations are the following:</p>
<p>1. <code class="language-kotlin">@Target</code>: as the name implies, this annotation indicates which kinds of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10730" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an element refers to an individual item contained within a collection. | A collection is a data structure that supports various operations such as retrieving, removing, changing, or replacing elements. However, it is important to note that operations like adding, removing, and changing elements only apply to mutable collections. Immutable collections cannot be changed and only allow operations that do not change the elements, such as accessing them. Elements can be encapsulated within a package, and to use them, we must indicate the complete name of the element, which includes the package name. When working with collections, mapping is a key action that simplifies the process of transforming elements from one collection to another. If a transformation function cannot be performed on some elements, the result for those elements will be null.">elements</a> can be targeted. Consider the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Target(AnnotationTarget.LOCAL_VARIABLE)
annotation class Special</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">AnnotationTarget</code> is an enum that contains a list of possible targets; you can find the full list in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.annotation/-annotation-target/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">@Special</code> annotation is applicable only to local variables. Consider the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    // applicable to local variables
    @Special val name = "Ali"

    // Error as this annotation 
    // is not applicable to target 'expression'
    println(@Special name)
}</code></pre>
<p> You can also target as many elements as you want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Target(
    AnnotationTarget.LOCAL_VARIABLE,
    AnnotationTarget.FIELD,
    AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION,
    AnnotationTarget.CLASS
)
annotation class Special</code></pre>
<p>If the <code class="language-kotlin">@Target</code> meta-annotation is not present in the annotation declaration, the annotation is applicable to the following elements by default: </p>
<ul><li><p>CLASS</p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a property represents data within an object and controls how this data is accessed and manipulated. | It is a mechanism to encapsulate data within our object and differs from a method, which performs a certain operation. A property holds state or data, while a method contains logic. Property overriding is a feature in Kotlin that allows you to modify the behavior or value of a property in a derived class, providing a new layer of flexibility. You can define a property in a base class and then override it in a derived class, extending the property just like you can inherit and extend methods in object-oriented programming. In Kotlin, properties take the place of fields seen in other languages, like Java, and have a strict type, which can be a standard type or a custom type, even the same class where the property is declared.">PROPERTY</a></p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a field is a variable or property declared inside a class that stores a value. | Fields can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, or other objects. They can be accessed and modified within the class they are declared in, and their visibility can be controlled using access modifiers such as `private`, `protected`, or `public`. To allow access to a private field from outside the class, getter and setter methods can be used. Fields can also be initialized through constructors and can have visibility modifiers specified for them.">FIELD</a></p></li><li><p>LOCAL_VARIABLE</p></li><li><p>VALUE_PARAMETER</p></li><li><p>CONSTRUCTOR</p></li><li><p>FUNCTION</p></li><li><p>PROPERTY_GETTER</p></li><li><p>PROPERTY_SETTER. </p></li></ul>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">@Target</code> meta-annotation is very useful when you need to make your custom annotation work only with specific elements: it guarantees that you always get the expected results.  </p>
<p>2. <code class="language-kotlin">@Retention</code>: this meta-annotation determines whether the annotation will be stored in binary output or the compiler will get rid of it when the program runs.</p>
<p>There are only three available options in the enum <code class="language-kotlin"> AnnotationRetention</code> that we can choose from:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;"><tbody><tr><td><p>SOURCE</p></td><td><p>Annotation isn't stored in binary output.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>BINARY          </p></td><td><p>Annotation is stored in binary output but is invisible for reflection.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>RUNTIME</p></td><td><p>Annotation is stored in binary output and is visible for reflection (default retention).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Let's take an example: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Target(AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.SOURCE)
annotation class VeryCool</code></pre>
<p>We have created an annotation called <code class="language-kotlin">VeryCool</code>, chosen functions as the only target, and finally specified that the annotation's retention will be <code class="language-kotlin">SOURCE</code>, which means that the annotation won't be stored in binary output and will be deleted when the program runs.</p>
<p>You may ask: why do we create an annotation that will be deleted later? Sometimes it's useful when we need the annotation to work only at the compile time, like in the case with the <code class="language-kotlin">@Suppress</code> annotation.</p>
<p>3.  Sometimes you want to apply an annotation to the same element multiple times, and here <code class="language-kotlin">@Repeatable</code> comes to the rescue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    @Special
    @Special
    @Special
    val name = "Ali"
}

@Repeatable
annotation class Special
</code></pre>
<p>4. <code class="language-kotlin">@MustBeDocumented</code> specifies that the annotation must be part of the element's generated documentation.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h5>
<p>In this topic, we have learned how to make our own custom annotations and how to specify their parameters. We've also learned different meta-annotations like <code class="language-kotlin">@Target</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">@MustBeDocumented</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">@Repeatable</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">@Retention</code>.</p>
<p>Annotating is easy, even if it might be a bit tricky the first time. Now, let's enforce our understanding with some practice.</p>
