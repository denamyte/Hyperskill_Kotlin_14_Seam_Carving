<h2>Welcome to Kotlin track</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Welcome to the Kotlin track! We've prepared a quick overview of the platform features to help you navigate through your learning journey. Let's dive in and see what you'll be working with.</p>
<h5 id="what-to-expect-from-your-study-plan">What to expect from your study plan</h5>
<p>Your study plan is organized into bite-sized interactive topics, much like a smart textbook that blends theory with practical tasks. If you're already familiar with certain concepts, you can <em>skip a topic</em> by solving a single problem and then move on to the next one.<br/>
<br/>
Each topic's practice section offers a variety of engaging problems and coding tasks. Once you submit your solution, you will get <em>feedback on your code quality</em>. If you find a problem too challenging, too simple, or just prefer not to solve it, you can <em>postpone</em> it and tackle another one.<br/>
<br/>
You can use the <em>knowledge map</em> to track your progress and see what else is in store for you. All tracks on Hyperskill are interconnected, so as you progress through one track, you're laying the foundation not just for the current language but for other programming areas as well!</p>
<h5 id="how-to-engage-with-other-learners">How to engage with other learners</h5>
<p>As you go through your studies, we want you to know that you're not alone. Every topic, problem, and project stage comes with dedicated sections for <em>comments, hints, solutions, and useful links</em>. If you're stuck, check out the hints or see what others have said in the comments. Once you've tackled a problem, you can compare your solution with those of others to gain new perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
You're also welcome to join our learners' <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hyperskill-690519958706192404" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Discord community</a>, where you can engage in discussions, seek help, or simply share your insights. It's your go-to place for Kotlin-related questions, whether you need assistance or just want to enjoy funny memes related to Kotlin development.</p>
<h5 id="becoming-more-professional">Becoming more professional</h5>
<p>Professional developers usually code in an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em>. You will use <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong> to write your code, check your solutions, debug issues, and synchronize your progress with Hyperskill. Don't worry about the setup; we'll show you how to do it once you get there!<br/>
<br/>
If you're an active Premium subscriber, you get to pick from a variety of exciting projects that vary in difficulty based on how many topics they touch on. When you choose a project, a <em>customized study plan</em> appears, showing just the topics you need to know to complete it. Each project is broken down into manageable stages, so you can build it one step at a time. After finishing a project, remember to upload it to GitHub — it's a great way to showcase your work to friends, colleagues, and potential employers.</p>
<h5 id="quick-tips-for-building-a-strong-learning-routine">Quick tips for building a strong learning routine </h5>
<p>To get the most of your learning experience, consider these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up a regular study schedule and block out specific times for learning in your calendar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you're short on time, just five minutes a day can help you develop a steady learning routine. Solve problems to keep your streak going!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you happen to miss a day, don't worry—just use the 1-day streak freeze to hold onto your progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat what you've learned to help you remember it better, and collect gems that you can exchange for rewards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Embarking on the Kotlin track means stepping into an engaging learning path that adapts to your pace and skills. You have the freedom to move quickly through topics you know well or to spend more time where you need it. Along the way, you'll connect with a supportive community eager to help and learn together. Plus, you'll get hands-on with a professional IDE, which will make your coding experience more efficient. Welcome aboard – we're excited to see you grow as a Kotlin developer!</p>
