<div class="step-text">
<p>In this topic, we will talk about the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> class, which provides a mutable <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a CharSequence is an interface that represents a sequence of characters. | It is designed to be immutable, meaning its content cannot be changed after it has been created.

In the context of flow processing, an operation can refer to a transformation that is applied to a flow of data to modify the data it emits. This can include operations such as filtering, mapping, or reducing the data in some way.">operations</a> in Kotlin.</p>

Additionally, read-only properties can be used in Kotlin to expose internal state in a safe and controlled manner, without allowing external code to modify it. This is achieved by using the `val` keyword to declare a property, as opposed to the `var` keyword which allows for reassignment of a new value.">immutability</a> has its benefits in terms of stability, it can also introduce certain challenges when it comes to string manipulation and concatenation.

<p>To address these challenges, Kotlin has a special <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class is a fundamental component in object-oriented programming that serves as a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors. | It is the most important and fundamental component in the logging package, and the standard practice is to create a logger instance for each class.

In addition to regular nested classes, Kotlin also has inner classes, which are a special case of nested classes. An inner class can access members of its outer class, making it useful in specific scenarios, such as creating a nested class for a cat's ribbon bow.

<p>In the above image, we demonstrate different ways of concatenating two strings. First, we used the <code class="language-kotlin">+</code> operator on <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> objects, which allocates new memory to store the combined string.</p>
<p>In the second one, we used a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object and its <code class="language-kotlin">append()</code> method (we will talk more about it in a while) to perform the concatenation. This time, no new memory was allocated. Instead, the original value was <strong>mutated</strong> to represent the combined result.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Don't confuse <strong>immutability</strong> with the use of <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> when declaring variables. Immutability refers to certain data types that cannot be changed in memory once they have been created.

<h5 id="constructors-of-stringbuilder">Constructors of StringBuilder</h5>
<p>There are two main ways to construct a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object in Kotlin: using the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> constructor and using the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function.</p>
<p>1. Using the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> constructor</p>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> class provides several constructors that allow you to create a new <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object. For example, you can create an empty <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> with the default initial <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, capacity refers to the maximum number of elements that a StringBuilder object can hold. | It is determined by the constructor used to create the object. If the default constructor is used, the initial capacity will be 16 characters. As elements are added, if the length exceeds the current capacity, the capacity will automatically increase to accommodate the additional elements. The new capacity is calculated using a specific formula. You can specify the capacity of the StringBuilder at the time of creation by passing an integer to the constructor. It is important to note that StringBuilder is a Java class, but can be used directly in Kotlin without importing anything.">capacity</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder()
</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify the initial capacity of the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> by passing an integer value to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a constructor is a special function used to set up a new instance of a class. | They are responsible for establishing the initial state of an object when it's created. Kotlin provides two kinds of constructors: primary and secondary. The primary constructor is part of the class header and is declared after the class name. It is characterized by being streamlined and cannot contain any code. Initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks. Secondary constructors are defined inside the class body using the keyword `constructor`. They are used when you need multiple methods to initialize your class and must delegate to the primary constructor either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor. Constructor in Kotlin aim to initialize properties with value passed to the constructor and carry out any initialization logic the class might need.">the constructor</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder(100)
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, you can create a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> that contains the same characters as a given <code class="language-kotlin">CharSequence</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> by passing it to the constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb1 = StringBuilder("Kotlin")
val sb2 = StringBuilder(sb1)
</code></pre>
<p>2. Using the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function</p>
<p>One of the features that make Kotlin stand out is its support for <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, functional programming is a style of programming that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. | It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. The Kotlin standard library provides many functions for collections, such as `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`, which are commonly used in functional programming. These functions allow you to process and transform data in a declarative way, without changing the original data.">functional programming</a></strong>. That is why a more convenient way to construct a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> is by using the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function. This function takes a lambda as an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an argument refers to the input parameters of a function. | These arguments are stored in an array of strings and can be accessed within the function. They are used to pass data into a function, similar to how you might set a file location when opening a file with open with.... Arguments can be named or positional, and there are options for default and named arguments. In overridden functions, argument naming guidelines should be followed.">argument</a> and allows you to build a string using a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> without having to explicitly create one. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val str = buildString {
    append("Hello")
    append(' ')
    append("Kotlin")
}
println(str) // Output: Hello Kotlin
</code></pre>
<p>We can also pass an initial capacity to the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/30148" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a lambda expression is a function without a name, allowing you to use and pass around code as data. | They are often more readable than function references and force developers to break down a program into smaller functions with clear responsibilities. For instance, you can call a function directly or by passing its value using a function reference. Lambda expressions have a reasonable type, just like top-level functions.

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val str = buildString(100) {
    // some code here
}</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function returns a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>, not a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">While <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> can be used to achieve many of the same results as using a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> directly, there may be some cases where using a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> directly provides more flexibility or control over the string manipulation process.</div>
<h5 id="methods-of-stringbuilder">Methods of StringBuilder</h5>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> provides several methods for manipulating strings, which allow you to easily <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a mutable object or data structure is one that is expected to be altered or modified after its creation. | This is in contrast to immutable objects, which cannot be changed once they are initialized. In the context of collections, a MutableList in Kotlin is a collection type that you can modify by adding, removing, or updating elements. Iterating over a MutableList and performing batch operations are common tasks in Kotlin programming. You can modify elements in a MutableList using functions like `map`, `filter`, and `forEach`. Similarly, a mutable variable is a variable that can be changed or modified after it has been declared and initialized. It is declared using the `var` keyword, which allows for reassignment of a new value to the variable. This is in contrast to an immutable variable, which is declared using the `val` keyword and cannot be changed once it has been initialized. In the context of maps, a mutable map is a map that allows you to easily modify its content. You can create a mutable map in a variety of ways, and it has the same properties and methods as a regular map, such as `get`, `containsKey`, `isEmpty`, and so on.">modify</a> the contents of a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object. Let's take a closer look at some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code class="language-kotlin">append</code> method: it allows you to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, 'add' is not a specific language term, but it can be a name of a function or a variable in a code. | Based on the provided context, it seems like we're discussing documentation and annotations in Kotlin. Therefore, I will provide an explanation of annotations related to the 'add' example in the context. Annotations in Kotlin, such as `@Suppress(UNUSED_VARIABLE)`, can be used to provide additional information to the compiler or tools like Dokka. In this example, `@Suppress` is used to inform the compiler to suppress a specific warning (in this case, the warning about an unused variable). The 'add' here refers to adding a specific warning suppression or annotation to a code element.">add</a> characters or strings to the end of a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>.

    append(1.8)        // Appending a Double
}
println(str) // Output: Kotlin v1.8
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code class="language-kotlin">insert</code> method: it allows you to insert characters or strings at a specific position in a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>. This method is also overloaded to accept different types of arguments.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val str = buildString {
    append("Hello World")
    insert(5, ",")
}
println(str) // Output: Hello, World
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li> The <code class="language-kotlin">delete</code> method: it allows you to remove characters or strings from a specific range in a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>.

<h5 id="length-vs-capacity">Length vs. capacity</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> class has two important members: <code class="language-kotlin">length</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">capacity()</code>. The <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a length is a measurement that describes the extent or size of an object or space in a single dimension. | It is commonly used to describe the size of arrays or lists, which can have one, two, or even multiple dimensions, such as length, width, and height. For example, a 2D array can be used to represent a map in a game, with one index for the row and another for the column. Similarly, a 3D array can be used to represent a 3D space, such as a multi-storey parking lot, with three indices for the floor, row, and place in a row.">length</a> </strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a property represents data within an object and controls how this data is accessed and manipulated. | It is a mechanism to encapsulate data within our object and differs from a method, which performs a certain operation. A property holds state or data, while a method contains logic. Property overriding is a feature in Kotlin that allows you to modify the behavior or value of a property in a derived class, providing a new layer of flexibility. You can define a property in a base class and then override it in a derived class, extending the property just like you can inherit and extend methods in object-oriented programming. In Kotlin, properties take the place of fields seen in other languages, like Java, and have a strict type, which can be a standard type or a custom type, even the same class where the property is declared.">property</a> represents the number of characters a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object contains, while the <strong>capacity</strong> method returns the number of characters it can hold before it needs to be resized.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder()
println("Length: ${sb.length}, Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}") // Output: Length: 0, Capacity: 16
sb.append("Hello!")
println("Length: ${sb.length}, Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}") // Output: Length: 6, Capacity: 16
</code></pre>
<p><picture><img alt="Difference between length and capacity" height="148" name="length vs capacityai.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8aaacf99-5bd7-4df8-a062-6f61b759b017/" width="600"/></picture></p>
<p>The capacity<strong> </strong>of a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> is the number of characters it can hold before it needs to be resized, and it is always greater than or equal to its length. When you create a new <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>, its initial capacity is determined by the constructor you use. If you use the default constructor, the initial capacity will be $16$ characters. If you pass a string when constructing a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>, it will add the length of that string to the initial capacity.</p>
<p>As you append new characters to a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>, its length increases. If the length exceeds the current capacity, the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> automatically increases its capacity to accommodate the additional characters. The new capacity is calculated using the following formula: <code class="language-kotlin">newCapacity = max(oldCapacity * 2 + 2, newLength)</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example that demonstrates how the capacity of a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> created with the default constructor changes as characters are added:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder()              // Capacity = initial capacity = 16
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}") // Output: Capacity: 16

sb.append("0123456789abcdef")         // (oldCapacity &gt;= newLength) then: newCapacity = oldCapacity
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}") // Output: Capacity: 16

sb.append('g')                        // // (oldCapacity &lt; newLength) then: newCapacity = max(oldCapacity * 2 + 2, newLength) = oldCapacity * 2 + 2
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}") // Output: Capacity: 34
</code></pre>
<p>And here is an example with a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> created by passing a string to its constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder("Kotlin!")   // Capacity = initial capacity + "Kotlin!".length = 16 + 7
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}")   // Output: Capacity: 23

sb.append("0123456789abcdef")           // (oldCapacity &gt;= newLength) then: newCapacity = oldCapacity
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}")   // Output: Capacity: 23

sb.append("0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef") // (oldCapacity &lt; newLength) then: newCapacity = max(oldCapacity * 2 + 2, newLength) = newLength
println("Capacity: ${sb.capacity()}, Length: ${sb.length}") // Output: Capacity: 55</code></pre>
<h5 id="best-practices">Best practices</h5>
<p>Here are some best practices for using the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> for <strong>complex</strong> string manipulation tasks. <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> is well-suited for complex string manipulation tasks, such as building or modifying a string incrementally. For simple <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4547" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, string concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. | It is a common operation when working with strings and is often used to build larger strings from smaller ones. The concatenation operator in Kotlin is the `+` symbol, which can be used to combine any two strings. When concatenating strings, the order of the strings matters, as the resulting string will be in the same order. For example, you can concatenate two strings using the `+` operator like this:

```
val string1 = Hello
val string2 = World
val result = string1 +   + string2
```

In this example, the `+` operator is used to concatenate the `string1` and `string2` variables, along with a space character, to create the `result` string. It is important to note that when concatenating strings using the `+` operator, a new string is created each time the operator is used. This can lead to performance issues if you are concatenating a large number of strings together. In these cases, it may be more efficient to use a `StringBuilder` object to build the string instead. Additionally, Kotlin provides a `concat()` function that can be used to concatenate multiple strings. This function takes a variable number of string arguments and returns a new string that is the concatenation of all the arguments.">string concatenation</a> tasks, it may be more efficient to use the <code class="language-kotlin">+</code> operator or string interpolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-allocate</strong> the capacity of the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>. If you know the approximate size of the final string, you can pre-allocate the capacity of the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> to reduce the number of times it needs to be resized. This can help improve performance by reducing the number of memory allocations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reuse</strong> the same <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object. If you need to perform multiple string manipulation operations, consider reusing the same <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object rather than creating a new one each time. This can help reduce memory overhead and improve performance. To do that, you can reset the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> to an empty state by calling its <code class="language-kotlin">setLength</code> method with an argument of $0$. This will clear the contents of the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> without changing its capacity, allowing you to reuse it for further string manipulation operations. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sb = StringBuilder()
sb.append("Java")
println(sb.toString()) // Output: Java
sb.setLength(0)
sb.append("Kotlin")
println(sb.toString()) // Output: Kotlin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convert</strong> a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> to a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> when finished. Once you have finished manipulating a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>, you may want to convert it to a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. This can be done easily by calling the <code class="language-kotlin">toString</code> method on the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object. Keep in mind that calling this method creates a new <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> object, so if you need to perform further string manipulation operations, it may be more efficient to continue using the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, here are some best practices for using the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> for <strong>simple</strong> string construction. The <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function is well-suited for simple string construction tasks, such as concatenating a small number of strings or building a string in a loop. For more complex string manipulation tasks, it may be more efficient to use a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid</strong> unnecessary object creation. When using the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function, avoid creating unnecessary objects, such as temporary strings or character arrays. Instead, use the methods available on the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> to manipulate the string directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong> the scope of the lambda. The <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function takes a lambda as an argument, which provides a convenient scope for building the string. Use this scope to your advantage by declaring local variables and functions that can help simplify your code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example that demonstrates these best practices:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val str = buildString {
    for (number in numbers) {
        append(number)
        append(' ')
    }
}
println(str) // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
</code></pre>
<p>In the example, we use the <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> function to construct a string by appending numbers and spaces in a loop. We avoid creating unnecessary objects by using the <code class="language-kotlin">append</code> method to manipulate the string directly. We also leverage the scope of the lambda by declaring a local variable (<code class="language-kotlin">number</code>) that simplifies our code.</p>

We discussed best practices for using both <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code>, including pre-allocating the capacity of the <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code>, reusing the same <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> object, and converting a <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> to a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> when finished.</p>
<p>Applying these concepts, you can use <code class="language-kotlin">StringBuilder</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">buildString</code> to effectively manipulate strings in your Kotlin programs. But first, let's put your knowledge into practice.</p>
