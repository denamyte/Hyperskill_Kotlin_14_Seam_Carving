<h5 id="hash-functions">Hash functions</h5>
<p>Hash functions are algorithms that take an input (or 'message') and return an output of fixed length. The main characteristic of these functions is their one-wayness: it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original message from the hash. Additionally, even a small change in the input produces a drastic change in the output, which is useful for checking data integrity.</p>
<p>Hash functions are essential in various security applications. For example, they are used for securely storing passwords in databases. Instead of storing the password in plain text, the hash of the password is stored. When a user attempts to authenticate, the hash function is applied to the entered password and result is compared with the stored hash. If the hash values match, the password is correct. Another example of using hash functions is checking the integrity of a file.</p>
<h5 id="md5-and-sha">MD5 and SHA</h5>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MD5 </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SHA</a> are two of the most well-known and widely used hash functions. MD5, which stands for 'Message Digest algorithm 5', produces a 128-bit hash, while SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash. SHA-256, a more secure version of SHA, produces a 256-bit hash, and SHA-512 produces a 512-bit hash.</p>
<p>Although MD5 is faster and produces a shorter hash than SHA-512, it has been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash. Therefore, MD5 has fallen out of use in favor of more secure hash functions like SHA-512. However, it is important to remember that no hash function is completely infallible, and security should always be an ongoing improvement process.</p>
<h5 id="messagedigest">MessageDigest</h5>
<p>The MessageDigest class in Kotlin is part of the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and provides functionality for cryptographic hash functions. It allows you to create instances of various hash algorithms, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc. It's important to note that hash functions provide one-way encryption, meaning it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original message from the hash. Therefore, they are primarily used for verification and comparison rather than decryption.</p>
<p>The primary use of the MessageDigest class is to compute the hash value (digest) of a given input message or data. This can be useful in several scenarios, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Password storage: When storing passwords, it is considered best practice not to store them directly. Instead, you can use a hash function like SHA-256 to compute the hash of the password and store the hash value. When a user attempts to log in, you can compute the hash of the entered password and compare it with the stored hash to verify the authenticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integrity: Hash functions can be used to ensure the integrity of data. By computing the hash of a file or a message before transmitting or storing it, you can later compare the computed hash with the received data to check if any modifications or tampering has occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital signatures: Digital signatures use hash functions to generate a unique hash value of a message or document. This hash value is then encrypted with the signer's private key, creating a digital signature. The recipient can use the signer's public key to decrypt the signature and verify the integrity and authenticity of the message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To use the MessageDigest class in Kotlin, you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get an instance of the MessageDigest class for the desired algorithm using the <code class="language-kotlin">getInstance()</code> method, specifying the algorithm name (e.g., "SHA-512").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the <code class="language-kotlin">update()</code> method on the MessageDigest instance to provide the input data or message to be hashed. You can update the digest multiple times if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the <code class="language-kotlin">digest()</code> method to compute the final hash value as an array of bytes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we can implement an extension function to demonstrate how to use the <code class="language-kotlin">MessageDigest</code> class to easily compute hashes of strings with different algorithms.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.security.MessageDigest

fun String.hash(mode: String): String {
    val bytes = this.toByteArray()
    val md = MessageDigest.getInstance(mode)
    val digest = md.digest(bytes)
    return digest.fold("", { str, it -&gt; str + "%02x".format(it) })
}

fun main() {
    val password = "password"
    println("MD5: " + password.hash("MD5"))
    println("SHA-256: " + password.hash("SHA-256"))
    println("SHA-512: " + password.hash("SHA-512"))

<p>The following example illustrates how to use the File class and the hash function to calculate the hash of a file with a specific algorithm, such as SHA-256. The computed hash can be used for integrity checks or verifying file integrity.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.io.File
import java.security.MessageDigest

fun File.hash(algorithm: String): ByteArray {
    val digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithm)
    this.inputStream().use { inputStream -&gt;
        val bytes = inputStream.readBytes()
        digest.update(bytes)
    }
    return digest.digest()
}

fun main() {
    val file = File("path/to/your/file")
    val sha256 = file.hash("SHA-256")
    println("File hash SHA-256: ${sha256.joinToString("") { "%02x".format(it) }}")

<h5 id="bcrypt">BCrypt</h5>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bcrypt </a>is a password hashing library designed to be secure against brute-force attacks. Unlike standard hash functions, Bcrypt is adaptive: as computing power increases, the computational cost of the hash can be increased. Additionally, Bcrypt automatically generates the "salt" for each hash, which prevents dictionary and rainbow table attacks.</p>
<p>The "salt" is a random value that is added to the password before applying the hash function. The salt is stored alongside the password hash and is used to prevent dictionary and rainbow table attacks. These attacks rely on precomputing the hash of common passwords or all possible passwords and searching for these hashes in the database. Adding the salt makes these attacks infeasible, as the precomputed hash will not be valid.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: a BCrypt hash function, for example, <code class="language-kotlin">hashpw()</code>, returns different values even for the same input because it incorporates a randomly generated salt during the hashing process. The salt is added to the input before hashing, making the resulting hash unique. The randomness and uniqueness of the salt ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different. To check if two different values correspond to the same hash value, a specific function is needed. BCrypt provides a check function, for example, <code class="language-kotlin">checkpw()</code>, which takes the input value and the stored hash value as arguments. It internally extracts the salt from the stored hash, applies it to the input, and hashes the input again. Then, it compares the newly generated hash with the stored hash. If they match, it means the input values correspond to the same hash value, indicating that the input is correct. This function ensures secure password verification without exposing the actual hash or salt.</p>
<p>The computational cost of Bcrypt is a balance between security and efficiency. A higher cost means brute-force attacks will be slower, but it also means user authentication will be slower (higher salt value). Therefore, a cost should be chosen high enough to deter attacks but not so high that it makes the application inefficient with the right salt value.</p>
<p>To work with BCrypt, we can use the jBCrypt library, which can be installed via Gradle.</p>
<p>Here's how you can install jBCrypt using Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">dependencies {
    implementation("org.mindrot:jbcrypt:0.4")
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the following example, we demonstrate how to use BCrypt to obtain the hash and verify it against a stored value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import org.mindrot.jbcrypt.BCrypt

fun hashPassword(password: String): String {
    return BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt()) // we can use 10 or 12 as salt value
}

fun checkPassword(password: String, hashedPassword: String): Boolean {
    return BCrypt.checkpw(password, hashedPassword)
}

fun main() {
    val password = "MySuperPassword"
    val hashedPassword = hashPassword(password)

    println(checkPassword("MySuperPassword", hashedPassword))  // Returns true
    println(checkPassword("OtherPassword", hashedPassword))  // Returns false
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Information security is crucial in any application, and hash functions and BCrypt are essential tools for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. Their proper use can prevent a multitude of attacks and ensure that our applications are secure and reliable. Let's always remember that security is not a product but a continuous process of improvement and adaptation to new threats. Now that you've learned about the tools, you can use them in your Kotlin applications. It's time to put your knowledge to the test with some tasks. Are you ready?</p>
