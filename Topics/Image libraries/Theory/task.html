<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>Digital image processing is the technique of using computers to process (view, edit, and transform) digital images. The benefit of using computers to process images is the ease of applying various edits or transformations to the image compared with analog processing.</p>
<p>Digital image processing has a wide range of applications spread across various industries – for example, processing satellite data and transforming it into maps, transforming real-life photographs into textures that can be used in video games, modifying your favorite profile picture using image filters, and many others.</p>
<p>Let's see how we can work with images in Kotlin!</p>
<h5 id="what-are-images">What are images?</h5>
<p>Before getting started, let's define what images actually are. An image is a two-dimensional collection of points of color encoding a visual – for example, a photograph or a piece of digital art. We distinguish between two types of image encodings: <strong>raster</strong> graphics and <strong>vector</strong> graphics.</p>
<p>A raster image is a dot matrix data structure containing a grid of pixels. Pixels are points of color (optionally, with a transparency value) in the two-dimensional (X, Y) screen space.</p>
<p>As they are maps of bits (hence the name bitmap), raster images cannot be scaled up or down to different resolutions without distortion (aliasing).</p>
<p>Vector images are points on a two-dimensional plane that are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other geometric shapes. As such, they can easily be redrawn at any scale without aliasing.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will be taking a look at raster graphics: their properties and representation in Kotlin, and ways to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, create generally refers to the action of instantiating a new object or initializing a new data structure with specific values. | In the context of maps, for example, you can create a new map using the map literal syntax, such as `mapOf(key to value)`, or by calling a builder function like `hashMapOf()`. When creating an instance of a class, you can use the constructor to initialize the object's state. In the example provided, a `Cat` class is created, and an instance of that class is created using the constructor `Cat(Garfield)`.">create</a>, edit, and read/store such <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an object is an instance of a class that stores data and defines its behavior. | It is a complex structure that has a state, which is the data stored in the object, and a behavior, which is defined by the functions associated with the object. The state of an object can be accessed through properties, which are accessed by putting a dot and the property name after the object. Objects are stored in memory, and variables and values simply point to these objects.">objects</a>.</p>
<h5 id="images-in-kotlin">Images in Kotlin</h5>
<p>In Kotlin, images are represented by the <code class="language-kotlin">java.awt.Image</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a class is a fundamental component in object-oriented programming that serves as a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and behaviors. | It is the most important and fundamental component in the logging package, and the standard practice is to create a logger instance for each class. A class can contain methods to perform specific tasks, and in the context of logging, it can introduce several methods to print log messages. For instance, the method is used to print log messages, taking a level object and a message as arguments. In addition to regular nested classes, Kotlin also has inner classes, which are a special case of nested classes. An inner class can access members of its outer class, making it useful in specific scenarios, such as creating a nested class for a cat's ribbon bow. Furthermore, Kotlin supports generic programming, which allows writing more abstract and reusable code.">class</a>. This is the class at the top of the hierarchy for all graphical images. For the purpose of this lesson, we will focus on an image subclass, <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code>. </p>
<p>A <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code> exposes the buffer of image data that can be <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a read is the process of obtaining data from a standard input stream. | This can include various types of data such as strings, numbers, etc. To accomplish this, you can use the `BufferedReader` object, which represents the standard input stream and provides convenient methods to work with it. Additionally, Kotlin is interoperable with Java libraries, allowing you to use Java tools such as `Scanner` to read data from standard input. When reading data, you can use methods such as `readLine()`, `readText()`, and others to suit your specific needs.">read</a> or modified. </p>
<h5 id="creating-images">Creating Images</h5>
<p>Creating an image from scratch is as simple as creating an instance of <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.awt.image.BufferedImage 

val height: Int = 800
val width: Int = 600
val image = BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB)</code></pre>
<p>The last parameter in this particular <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a constructor is a special function used to set up a new instance of a class and establish the initial state of an object when it's created. | There are two kinds of constructors in Kotlin: primary and secondary. The primary constructor is part of the class header and is declared after the class name. Its main characteristics are initializing properties with values passed to the constructor and carrying out any necessary initialization logic. Kotlin's clean syntax and support for default parameter values often reduce the need for multiple constructors, leading to more clear and manageable code. However, constructor overriding is not allowed directly in Kotlin.">constructor</a> represents the image type. The <code class="language-kotlin">TYPE_INT_RGB</code> represents an image with 8 bits (or one byte) per color component, with the colors Red, Green, and Blue stored in 3 bytes.</p>
<p>Other examples of image types are:</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">TYPE_INT_ARGB</code>, which includes a transparency (sometimes called an alpha) component;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">TYPE_BYTE_GRAY</code>, which only includes a single byte value to encode a grayscale color.</p></li></ul>
<p>In our example, we did not add an alpha component, which means the image can not have transparency associated with its pixel data.</p>
<h5 id="editing-images">Editing Images</h5>
<p>In order to edit images, we could directly access the pixel matrix in the <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code>; however, this is very inconvenient, especially if we want to draw more complex geometry, such as lines, polygons, text, or other images. </p>
<p>Luckily, there is a more convenient way to do this. From a <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code>, we can create a <code class="language-kotlin">Graphics2D</code> by using the <code class="language-kotlin">createGraphics()</code> method. </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val graphics = image.createGraphics()</code></pre>
<p>This class offers a lot of convenient methods for two-dimensional drawing, such as:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawString(String, Int, Int)</code> </p><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawString(String, Float, Float)</code></p></td><td><p>Draws a string at the specified (x, y) coordinates.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawLine(x1: Int, y1: Int, x2: Int, y2: Int)</code></p></td><td><p>Draws a line between the given points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawPolygon(IntArray, IntArray, Int)</code></p></td><td><p>Draws a polygon between the points with x-coordinates contained in the first <code class="language-kotlin">IntArray</code> and y-coordinates in the second <code class="language-kotlin">IntArray</code>. The third parameter is the number of points contained in the arrays.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawOval(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int)</code></p></td><td><p>Draws an oval at (x, y) with the specified width and height.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawPolyline(IntArray, IntArray, Int)</code></p></td><td><p>Draws a sequence of connected lines (a polyline). The parameters are the same as for drawing a polygon.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-kotlin">drawRect(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, height: Int)</code> </p></td><td><p>Draws the outline of the specified rectangle.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> Building on the newly created image above, drawing a string becomes as simple as: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">graphics.drawString("Playing with images", 80, 80)

graphics.color = Color.ORANGE

graphics.drawArc(200, 200, 100, 250, 45, 90)</code></pre>
<p>The code above will draw a white (the default color) string at the position (80, 80). It will then change the drawing color to orange and use it to draw an arc at (200, 200) of width 100 and height 250, with a start angle of 45 and an arc angle of 90.</p>
<h5 id="writing-and-reading-images">Writing and Reading Images</h5>
<p>Instead of programmatically creating an image from scratch, the <code class="language-kotlin">javax.imageio.ImageIO</code> class offers many convenient methods for encoding (writing) and decoding (reading) images from files in the supported formats.  </p>
<p>Format is the binary encoding of an image, and the following formats are supported out of the box: JPEG, PNG, BMP, WBMP, and GIF.</p>
<p>In order to save this newly created image, we will use the <code class="language-kotlin">ImageIO.write(im: BufferedImage, formatName: String, output: File)</code> method and save the image as a PNG file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.awt.image.BufferedImage
import java.io.File
import javax.imageio.ImageIO

val height: Int = 800
val width: Int = 600

val image = BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB)
val imageFile = File("myFirstImage.png")

saveImage(image, imageFile)   

fun saveImage(image: BufferedImage, imageFile: File) {
  ImageIO.write(image, "png", imageFile)
}</code></pre>
<p>With the file saved to disk, we can reuse it later to continue our work. We will continue by adding a red triangle to the image we have created so far. </p>
<p>The first step to do this is to read the file into a <code class="language-kotlin">BufferedImage</code> using the <code class="language-kotlin">ImageIO.read(File input)</code> function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.awt.Color
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage
import java.io.File
import javax.imageio.ImageIO

val imageFile = File("myFirstImage.png")

val image: BufferedImage = ImageIO.read(imageFile)</code></pre>
<p>Secondly, we need to obtain a <code class="language-kotlin">Graphics2D</code> instance, and change the color to red.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val graphics = image.createGraphics()

graphics.color = Color.RED</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we will use the <code class="language-kotlin">Graphics2D.drawPolygon(IntArray, IntArray, Int)</code> function to draw our triangle. Remember that the parameters are: an array containing the X-axis coordinates, a second array containing the corresponding Y-axis coordinates, and the size of the arrays.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">graphics.drawPolygon(intArrayOf(10, 20, 30), intArrayOf(100, 20, 100), 3)</code></pre>
<p>Defining the form of a triangle is beyond the scope of the current lesson. However, note that the points must form an area greater than zero, and be non-collinear. Finally, in order to save the newly drawn triangle, let’s reuse the <code class="language-kotlin">saveImage</code> function defined above.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">saveImage(image, imageFile)</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Image processing has many applications, and the standard libraries we've covered facilitate the creation and manipulation of image <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a data class is a special type of class that automatically provides implementations for several commonly used functions when declared with primary constructor containing properties. | These functions include `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`, as well as component functions for each property defined in the primary constructor.

To recap, we have covered what images are, how they are represented in Kotlin, and how we can create images from scratch. Finally, we looked at how to edit images and how to read images from and save them to files.</p>
